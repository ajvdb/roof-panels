Roof panel calculation for a transition (i.e. TARDIS roof panels)of one size rectangle (i.e. the body of a TARDIS model) to another (i.e. a cubic 'light' atop the TARDISroof)

Printing the page at 100% scale will provide templates for the panel

Currently the size of the panels is limited to what can fit in the 200 by 250 mm display area for the two panels shapes and accompanying text.
